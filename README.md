# Addition PROMPT OF GPT TO EDIT PHOTO TO PROFESSIONAL LOOK

Edit this image to create an editorial portrait look. Keep my original face and expression. Change my outfit to a sharp, textured red blazer with layered gold chains. Set the background to a deep amber-red gradient. Apply dramatic, high-detail lighting: strong directional hard light from the left to highlight my cheekbones and jawline, leaving a soft but deep shadow on the right side of my face. Enhance my skin texture with ultra-crisp detail and soft shadows for a cinematic, freeze-frame effect. Add a soft bloom where the gold chains catch the light, with minimalist composition and a powerful, clean framing.
